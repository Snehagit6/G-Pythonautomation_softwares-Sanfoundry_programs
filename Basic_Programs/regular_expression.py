#Function compile()
# Regular expressions are compiled into pattern objects, which
# have methods for various operations such as searching for pattern
# matches or performing string substitutions.

# \d   Matches any decimal digit, this is equivalent
#      to the set class [0-9].
#\d+   Matches any decimal digit, this is equivalent
        # to the set class [0-9].
# \D   Matches any non-digit character.
# \s   Matches any whitespace character.
# \S   Matches any non-whitespace character
# \w   Matches any alphanumeric character, this is
#      equivalent to the class [a-zA-Z0-9_].
# \W   Matches any non-alphanumeric character,viz.special characters
